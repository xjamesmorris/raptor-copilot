"""Content-free working-tree dirtiness probe for TARGET repositories.

A scanned target can arrive with its own hostile ``.git``: a committed
``* filter=x`` .gitattributes plus a ``filter.x.clean`` command in
``.git/config`` turns any probe that re-hashes worktree content into
command execution at the operator's uid, and the filter's config key
is repo-chosen so no finite ``-c`` override list neutralises it (the
KNOWN LIMIT in ``core.git.clone``). ``git status`` re-hashes via the
index refresh — but so do the plumbing commands folklore calls safe:
``git diff-index HEAD`` (worktree side), ``diff-files`` and
``ls-files -m`` all re-READ file content through the filter chain for
*racily clean* entries (cached mtime not older than the index's own
mtime), and the racy window is attacker-controllable because the
hostile repo ships its own index — every entry can be crafted racy.

The only git surface that never opens worktree files is: index/HEAD
comparison (``diff-index --cached``), index dumps (``ls-files``,
``ls-files --debug``), tree dumps (``ls-tree``), and the
``ls-files --others`` directory walk. So worktree-vs-index change
detection happens HERE, in Python: each index entry's cached stat
data (``ls-files --debug``) is compared against ``os.lstat`` — the
same size/mtime test git itself applies, minus the content
re-verification of racy entries.

Accepted trade-offs (the first two over-report, conservatively; the
last two are misses):

* a stat-touched but content-identical file counts dirty;
* a sparse-checkout / skip-worktree entry with no file on disk counts
  dirty;
* a same-size edit landing in the same mtime nanosecond is missed;
* chmod-only changes are missed (the stat dump carries no mode).

The misses are not edge-case coincidences against a hostile target:
the index's cached stat data is itself part of the attacker-shipped
``.git``, so an entry whose cached size/mtime matches a substituted
file is constructible at will — ``dirty == False`` over different
content, by the adversary's design. A clean verdict from an untrusted
repository is therefore only a cache-freshness heuristic (exactly the
stat trust git itself applies), NEVER a trust, integrity, or
provenance signal. Consumers that need "this worktree matches HEAD"
as a security claim must hash content through a non-git channel
instead.
