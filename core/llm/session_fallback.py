"""Session-transport fallback for dispatcher-only model chains.

This fallback is forbidden under Copilot: another harness is not the active
session's authenticated service. The service-policy refusal happens before
dispatcher bootstrap and outside the recovery handlers below.

The Bedrock provider is dispatcher-only by design: workers never hold
AWS credentials, so ``create_provider`` hard-refuses without
``RAPTOR_LLM_SOCKET`` (the guard is correct and stays). Launcher runs
inherit a route from the parent; standalone CLIs self-serve one via
``core.llm.dispatcher.lifecycle.ensure_route_for_client``. But that
bootstrap is fire-and-forget — when it cannot come up (agent-dispatched
process without seedable credentials, socket-dir failure), the client
is left with a chain that refuses EVERY call: the default config on a
Bedrock-routed host resolves ``Primary: bedrock / Fallbacks: 0``, so
there is no claudecode entry to catch the fall-through, and each call
pays a provider-guard failure cascade. (A world-readable
``models.json`` with inline keys is NOT one of these cases: the
shared permission gate refuses at client construction —
``core.llm.detection._read_config_models`` — so no client reaches
this module and the security refusal is never converted into
continued LLM use.)

:func:`client_with_session_fallback` closes that gap the way the
/agentic --gap-audit path already works on claude-code-only installs
(``core.audit.gap_ranking`` builds a default client whose autodetect
lands on the claudecode session transport when nothing else is
configured): after the normal self-serve attempt, a chain that is
entirely dispatcher-only with still no route falls back to the
claudecode session transport — the same ``_build_claudecode_config``
the default resolution order ends on. No session transport either →
exactly ONE operator-facing notice and ``None``, so the caller can
degrade cleanly instead of paying one refusal cascade per call.

The provider guard itself is untouched: this module never routes a
dispatcher-only model without a socket — it swaps the transport.

Consent posture: a dispatcher-only primary exists only when the
operator explicitly configured Bedrock (``models.json`` /
``_config_bedrock_primary`` — ambient AWS credentials never produce
one), so the swap reroutes prompts away from that explicit choice to
the claude CLI's backend. The fallback-taken notice names the opt-out
so the operator learns of it exactly when it first fires:
``RAPTOR_NO_SESSION_FALLBACK=1`` disables the swap entirely and
restores the plain refusal behaviour.
