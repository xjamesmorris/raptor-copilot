"""Seam-level pins for the group scan's mount-churn verdict —
hermetic on any Linux host (no mount capability needed; the kernel
latch contract itself is pinned live in
test_supervised_scan_churn_live.py).

The two-sided race these pin: a mount attached after the pre-scan
declaration read and detached before the post-scan one is applied to
the scan yet appears in neither read. The scan therefore latches a
mount-event signal at its fd OPEN and takes exactly ONE verdict poll
after the last evidence read; a pending signal is occlusion. The poll
CONSUMES the signal, which makes any extra poll-type operation on the
fd a silent-verify vector of its own — the single-consumer contract
gets its own pins here (call count, position, and the fresh-fd-per-
attempt retry shape).

Fleet-kill doctrine: no test here signals anything; all scans run
against this process's own group with the /proc listing pinned to the
test's own pid.
