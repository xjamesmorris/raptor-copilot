"""HMAC provenance for checklist ``checked_by`` review claims.

``checklist.json`` lives in run/project directories that are
target-writable during runs and restorable verbatim by ``/project
import`` — and its per-item ``checked_by`` labels are analysed/reviewed
state: the coverage backfill folds them into the coverage store under
review-grade tool labels, and store marks at that grade clear functions
out of every store-derived review-gap view. Rows were plain
unauthenticated JSON, so a forged ``checked_by`` row minted review
credit that durably suppressed review of a function.

Writers stamp each review CLAIM — one ``(item, label)`` pair — at the
moment the label is appended (:func:`core.inventory.coverage.
update_coverage`, the only code that adds one); read-modify-write
writers (rebuild carry-forward, project promotion) copy tokens
verbatim, so a planted row stays unstamped no matter how many
legitimate saves follow — the per-row-not-per-record laundering
argument from ``core.coverage.journal_mac.mint_coverage_row``. The one
consumer that converts claims into authority
(``core.coverage.importer.import_checked_by``) verifies before
granting a claim the record's tool label; unverified review-grade
claims demote to the ``<label>:machine`` hint tier
(``core.coverage.registry.classify``) — readable, loud, never a hard
refusal. Same trust story and key-handling discipline as
``core/coverage/journal_mac.py``.

Per-claim, not per-file/per-shard, deliberately: every checklist write
is a full read-modify-write through the accessors, so a file-, shard-,
or manifest-level token minted at the write chokepoint would re-stamp
— launder — any planted row sitting in the file when a legitimate
writer next saved it. Claims are also independent of shard membership,
file order, and byte offsets, so the sharded ``checklist/`` layout can
repack entries freely without touching token validity.

The claim payload covers identity (file, class, name, kind, label),
the item's line range (the importer resolves the store interval from
the row's own line fields — an uncovered range would let an attacker
stretch one stamped row's interval over the whole file), and the file
entry's content ``sha256``. The sha256 binding stops SPLICES (a
genuine token pasted onto a different file entry fails), not REPLAY
(a whole historical entry pasted verbatim — old sha256, old lines,
genuine token — still verifies: the MAC binds the claim to the
presented entry, never to the current source). Replay currency is
the importer's job: ``import_checked_by`` compares the entry's
``sha256`` to a hash of the current source and demotes verified
claims that no longer match. Claims are deliberately NOT run-bound:
like journal rows, checklist marks aggregate across runs by design
(project promotion merging an older run's validly stamped claim is
the feature); a replayed stamped claim is genuine install history for
the exact file content it names.

Key
    ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/raptor/checklist-mac.key`` (default
    ``~/.local/share/raptor/checklist-mac.key``). Deliberately its OWN
    key file — per-purpose keys keep reset/rotation semantics scoped
    (``core.security.mac_key`` doctrine: never unify key files). No
    rotation: deleting the key demotes every stamped claim to the
    unstamped hint tier and new mints re-key lazily; no other
    subsystem's trust surface is touched.
