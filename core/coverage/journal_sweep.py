"""Project-wide review-journal reindex sweep.

Motivation (live incident): healing a project index whose rows a
version-skewed merge had damaged took TWO manual
``journal reindex <run-dir>`` invocations — the tampered rows' intact
source of truth was a PRIOR run's journal, so reindexing the current
run re-merged as a no-op and the damage stayed. The remedy should be
one command: re-project EVERY run of the project through the exact
single-run merge path.

Ordering — oldest→newest, and why. The merge is order-commutative for
almost everything: cross-timestamp content resolves by latest-wins (a
max), and the same-``ts`` repair tie-break is monotone toward the
verifying copy. The one genuinely order-sensitive case is same key,
EQUAL ``ts``, different bodies where the stored copy is not
out-verified — the first-merged copy wins (an incoming row never
replaces a same-``ts`` stored copy it cannot out-verify). Sweeping
oldest→newest replays the chronology the original run-completion
merges applied, so the sweep converges the index to the state it
would have had absent damage. Pinned by
``test_sweep_order_is_oldest_first``.

Safety:

* The project ``.op.lock`` is held for the sweep's WHOLE duration —
  live-writer gate, index pre-flight, and every merge run inside it.
  Without it the gate was check-then-act: a run that STARTED
  mid-sweep was unfenced, and the window was two-sided (a run
  start's own contention gate holds this flock across its
  check-and-write window, so a lockless sweep was invisible to it).
  Lock order and acquisition posture: see the rationale comment in
  :func:`reindex_project_journals`.
* Wholesale refusal BEFORE any merge while a live run owns the
  project (``core.run.metadata._live_conflicting_run`` — the same
  gate run starts use), with ``self_session_pid=None`` so even this
  session's own runs contend: the sweep rewrites the shared index and
  a racing completion merge could interleave with it. Stale-lock
  semantics are inherited from the gate: dead recorded pids, legacy
  pid-less metadata, imported-run markers, and foreign-stamped
  holders past the 24h ceiling with a write-quiet dir never block.
* THE RUN PIN decides, per run — the sweep resolves each run through
  ``core.run.metadata._journal_project_dir`` (the resolution run
  completion's merge uses) and skips runs that resolve to no project
  or to a different one; nothing is ever force-merged.
* Import-restored runs are skipped wholesale (their journals were
  minted on the exporting machine), matching
  ``core.run.metadata.project_run_projections``.
* Index-only writes: every merge goes through
  ``core.coverage.journal.merge_run_into_index`` — no run's journal
  file is ever mutated.
