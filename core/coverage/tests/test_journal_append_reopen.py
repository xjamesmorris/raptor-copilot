"""Foreign-appender rename-race protection in ``append_entry``.

The contract under test: a compactor's tempfile+rename swap between
an appender's ``open`` and its ``flock`` must never make the append
land on the renamed-away (archived) inode — the post-flock
``(dev, ino)`` re-validation releases the stale fd and retries the
open by name, bounded, failing loud when the journal keeps being
swapped from under it.
