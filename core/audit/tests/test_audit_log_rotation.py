"""Audit-log shard rotation: writer roll, loader honesty, MAC lane.

The ``.audit-log.jsonl`` trail historically had a whole-log read
budget whose overflow arm silently returned ``[]`` — a production
multi-segment run crossed it and every consumer (resume suppression,
fail-open deferral, telemetry) read an empty trail for the rest of
the run. The writer now rolls to numbered sibling shards below the
per-shard budget and the loader reads the contiguous set, disclosing
anything the budgets kept out. These tests pin:

- the roll threshold in BOTH directions (below → same shard,
  above → next shard) and the shard-count bound in both directions;
- loader honesty on the legacy oversize single-file shape (newest
  tail, never a silent ``[]``) plus the complete-load direction;
- the per-row run-bound MAC across a rotation boundary — rows are
  bound to the run dir, not the file name, so a verified load must
  return rows from EVERY shard while forged rows anywhere stay
  invisible to authority-bearing readers.
