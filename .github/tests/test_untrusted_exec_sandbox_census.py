"""Doc-lint: instruction lanes that build or run the untrusted target
stay inside the sandbox.

Why this test exists
--------------------
The crash-analysis workflow hands agents a HOSTILE repository (cloned
from a public bug tracker) and instructs them to rebuild it and run
the resulting binary. The mechanical containment for that class of
operation is `libexec/raptor-run-sandboxed`; an instruction file that
shows a bare `make` / `./program` recipe, an `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
+ direct-run idiom, or a "fall back to direct execution" escape hatch
steers the agent into executing attacker code with the operator's
full ambient authority. Nothing enforces these instructions
mechanically — the agents run Bash freely — so the instruction text
IS the control, and this census pins it.

Same doctrine for the exploit personas: the live prompt lane
(packages/llm_analysis/crash_agent.py) mandates inlining the
vulnerability trigger in the PoC because RAPTOR runs PoCs under
Landlock and cross-binary execution is blocked; a persona telling the
model to `system("./vulnerable_binary ...")` re-opens the bare-exec
lane for every free-Bash session that loads it.

One documented exemption: `rr record`. rr needs `ptrace` and perf
counters, which the sandbox denies, so recording the untrusted binary
runs bare by explicit decision. The census does not ban the idiom; it
pins that the exemption rationale travels IN THE SAME FILE as every
`rr record` recipe (test below) — a bare recording instruction with no
stated residual is drift, not a decision.
