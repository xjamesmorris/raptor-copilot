"""Cross-session JVM heap admission ledger.

Every joern JVM RAPTOR spawns (the query server, joern-parse
frontends) carries an ``-Xmx`` sized by the tuning derivation, and
the derivation assumes an otherwise-idle host. Run N sessions
concurrently and each derives the same near-host-sized heap
independently: the committed Xmx sum crosses physical RAM and the
kernel OOM-kills whichever JVM happens to grow last — correlated
mid-run server deaths under fleet load, each session convinced its
own limits were fine.

The ledger arbitrates at SPAWN time, not at derivation time: a
spawner reserves its heap in a flock-guarded host-global file BEFORE
exec, and the grant is clamped to what the host budget minus live
reservations can still carry. Rows are keyed on
``(pid, /proc starttime)``: a reservation whose owner died — crashed
session, OOM-killed JVM, hard external kill — is evicted at the next
admission, so leaked reservations self-heal without any release
protocol (``release()`` still exists for prompt reclaim, and the
shared query server relies on eviction: the session that finally
kills it at refcount zero is usually not the one that booted it).

Only DERIVED heaps are clamped. An explicit operator heap is an
assertion — the same both-directions rule the retry-at-derived-max
path follows: it is REGISTERED so other spawners see the pressure,
but never reduced.
