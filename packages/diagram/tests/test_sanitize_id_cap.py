"""sanitize_id length cap — both directions, plus collision surfacing.

Mermaid node ids land UNQUOTED in diagram positions and diagrams.md is
catted to operator terminals; the charset strip already makes the bytes
inert, so length is the remaining channel — without a cap a
megabyte-long alnum id survives verbatim into the rendered document.
