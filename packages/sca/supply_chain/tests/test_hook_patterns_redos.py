"""ReDoS regression tests for the shared hook-pattern substrate.

The curl/wget pipe-to-shell patterns previously used
``\\s+[^|]*\\s*`` — three adjacent overlapping quantifiers (the
negated class includes whitespace), quadratic on ``curl`` followed by
a long whitespace run with no pipe.  These tests pin:

  * the pathological input completes fast,
  * detection semantics are unchanged on the shapes we care about,
  * ``analyse_body`` bounds every regex input while scanning the
    whole body (truncation, where it still happens, fails toward
    review instead of silence).
